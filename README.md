title: About

Hi &mdash; I'm **Nik** (or **Nikola**), a human living in gorgeous Southern California.

I was born and raised in what is today Bosnia and Herzegovina, but have called the Golden State home for the past seventeen years. I quite like it here.

By day I'm a web developer working primarily with Python and the whole frontend stack, and by night I'm Batman…or asleep. Usually asleep.

Things I like other than writing code:

- driving cars,
- riding motorcycles,
- riding bicycles,
- lifting weights,
- petting cats,
- drinking whiskey,
- pretending to read,
- listening to podcasts,
- watching MotoGP&trade;,
- the color orange.

and
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nkantar 'Nik Kantar on LinkedIn'),
but
[email](mailto:nik@nkantar.com 'nik@nkantar.com')
is probably the best way to get in touch directly.
