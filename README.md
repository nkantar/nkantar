Hi—I’m **Nik** (or **Nikola**). I'm a human living in wonderful Los Angeles, California.

I was born and raised in what is today Bosnia and Herzegovina, but have called the Golden State home since 2002. I quite like it here.

By day I’m a software engineer working primarily with Python, and by night I’m Batman…or asleep. Usually asleep.

Things I like other than writing code:

- driving cars,
- riding motorcycles,
- riding bicycles,
- lifting weights,
- petting cats,
- drinking bourbon,
- pretending to read,
- listening to podcasts,
- watching MotoGP™,
- the color orange.
