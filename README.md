# Hi—I’m Nik.

What have _you_ broken today? :fire:

Jokes aside, there’s more from me on [**nkantar.com**] (namely the [**blog**]) and sometimes I tweet as [**@nkantar**].
What follows here is a v. quick rundown of what I’m working on in my spare time these days.

I’m currently mainly focusing on :fountain_pen: [**Microblot**], a platform for microblogging via chat.

I also maintain a few other projects (in no particular order):

- :snake: [**Parsenvy**] ([docs][parsedocs], [package][parsepackage]) is a Python environment variable parsing library.
- :octocat: [**Autohook**] is a tiny Git hook manager.
- :star: [**Starminder**] ([site][star]) reminds you of GitHub projects you’ve starred.
- :link: [**sus**] is a static redirect generator.
- :classical_building: [**pep20.org**] ([site][pep20]) is a website dedicated to one of my favorite things about Python.
- :control_knobs: [**The Mix Never Dies**] ([site][tmnd]) is an archive of songs I’ve liked on Spotify.

There’s more here, but it’s probably not really all that interesting. :grin:
