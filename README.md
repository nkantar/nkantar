# Hi.

What have _you_ broken today? :fire:

Jokes aside, while there’s more about me on [nkantar.com](https://nkantar.com "Nik Kantar")—namely my [blog](https://www.nkantar.com/blog/ "Blog | Nik Kantar")—here is a quick rundown of what I’m working on in my spare time these days.

I’m currently mainly focusing on :fountain_pen: [**Microblot**](https://github.com/nkantar/Microblot "nkantar/Microblot on GitHub"), a platform for microblogging via chat.

I also maintain a few other projects (in no particular order):

- :octocat: [**Autohook**](https://github.com/Autohook/Autohook "Autohook/Autohook on GitHub") is a tiny Git hook manager.
- :snake: [**Parsenvy**](https://github.com/nkantar/Parsenvy "nkantar/Parsenvy on GitHub") is a Python environment variable parsing library.
- :star: [**Starminder**](https://github.com/nkantar/Starminder "nkantar/Starminder on GitHub") ([site](https://starminder.xyz "Starminder")) reminds you of GitHub projects you’ve starred.
- :control_knobs: [**The Mix Never Dies**](https://github.com/nkantar/TheMixNeverDies.com "nkantar/TheMixNeverDies.com on GitHub") ([site](https://themixneverdies.com "The Mix Never Dies")) is an archive of songs I’ve liked on Spotify.
- :classical_building: [**pep20.org**](https://pep20.org "PEP 20 ~ The Zen of Python") is a website dedicated to one of my favorite things about Python.
- :link: [**sus**](https://github.com/nkantar/sus "nkantar/sus on GitHub") is a static redirect generator.

There’s more here, but it’s probably not really all that interesting. :grin:
